# Weather-Journal App Project

## Discription

    It's begin with starter code by cloning the file of Html and css prepared by 'Udacity' ,
I make some adjustment on `server.js` file and `website/app.js` file to create an asynchronous web app
that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI and I made some minor adjustments on `style.css`file .

## The languages used

1- HTML       : the standard markup language for Web pages.
2- Css        : the language we use to style an HTML document.
3- Javascript : the programming language of the Web.

## What was implemented in this project

      1- setup a Node environment with Express , npm modules body-parser and cors
      2- setup a server with GET and POST routes
      3- create developer credentials for a Web API
      4-use the Fetch API with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes
      5-access a GET route on the server side, from a function called on the client side
      6-chain Promises together
      7-access HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamically
